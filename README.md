building a NodeJS/Express web-app to POST/GET data from MongDB via Mongoose - Ajax JQuery + Bootstrap view

See the live demo here [live demo here](https://messages-web-app.herokuapp.com).

# Note
It is obviously an incredibly rudimentary RESTful web application. 
It does not care about flexibility, maintainability, or future additions. The purpose 
was simply to familiarize you with data manipulation on a single page, ajax-driven data manipulation in Node / Express / MongoDB. I hope it's accomplished!
